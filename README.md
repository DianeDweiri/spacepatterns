# SpacePatterns: Exploring the Secrets of Exoplanets

## Overview
This project analyzes data about exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) to discover interesting patterns and relationships. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we visualize the connection between planet mass and radius among other features.

## Dataset
The dataset used is from NASA's Exoplanet Archive and contains information on various exoplanets including their mass, radius, and host star properties.

## Features Analyzed
- Planet name
- Planet mass (relative to Jupiter)
- Planet radius (relative to Earth)
- Host star effective temperature
- Host star mass and radius

## Visualizations
Scatter plots showing the relationship between planet mass and radius help to identify trends and clusters among different types of exoplanets.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed along with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to explore the data and visualizations.
